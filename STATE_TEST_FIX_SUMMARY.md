# State Test Fix Summary

## Issue
The `test_save_state` test was failing because it expected the StateManager to write directly to the state file, but the implementation uses atomic writes for safety.

## Root Cause
The `save_state` method in StateManager uses a safe atomic write pattern:
1. Write to a temporary file (`.tmp`)
2. Use `Path.replace()` to atomically rename the temp file to the final file

This prevents file corruption if the process crashes during writing.

## Solution
Updated the test to properly mock the atomic write pattern:
1. Added `@patch("pathlib.Path.replace")` to mock the file replacement
2. Changed the assertion to check for the temp file path instead of the final path
3. Added assertion to verify that `replace()` was called

## Test Results
All 24 tests in `test_state.py` now pass:
- 6 tests for TaskState class
- 18 tests for StateManager class

The fix preserves the robust atomic write behavior while making the test accurately reflect the implementation.
