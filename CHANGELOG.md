## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-25

### üêõ Fixed

- **Removed deprecated `claude_command` configuration**
  - The `claude_command` setting is no longer needed since the tool uses the Claude Code Python SDK directly
  - Removed all references from configuration files, sample configs, and test files
  - This cleanup improves clarity and prevents confusion about the SDK-based architecture

### üßπ Maintenance

- Simplified configuration structure
- All 107 tests continue to pass

### üöÄ Added

- **New `--init` command** for generating sample configuration files
  - Creates comprehensive TOML configuration with examples and detailed comments
  - Supports custom filenames: `prompter --init my-config.toml`

  - Includes examples for multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C/C++, Java)
  - Built-in overwrite protection with user confirmation
  - Provides clear next-steps guidance after generation

- **Enhanced CI/CD pipeline** with format checking
  - Added `ruff format --check` to GitHub Actions workflow
  - New `make format-check` target for local development
  - Updated `make all` to include format validation

### üîß Improved

- **Major CLI module refactoring** for better maintainability
  - Split monolithic 364-line `cli.py` into organized package structure:

    - `cli/status.py` - Status display functionality (22 lines)
    - `cli/main.py` - Main orchestration logic (141 lines)
  - Maintained full backward compatibility with thin wrapper
  - Improved code organization with single responsibility principle
  - Enhanced testability with isolated components

- **Comprehensive test coverage** for new functionality
  - Added 6 new tests for `--init` functionality
  - All 107 tests passing with 91.87% code coverage
  - Updated test import paths for new module structure

### üìö Documentation

- **Improved code organization** with better separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive sample configurations** with practical examples

### üõ†Ô∏è Development
