# Parallel Execution Tests Fixed

## Summary

Successfully fixed all tests in `tests/test_parallel_execution.py`. All 9 tests now pass without hanging.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Exclusive Task Handling
- Added `exclusive_task_running` field to ResourcePool to track when an exclusive task is active
- Updated `allocate()` and `release()` methods to properly manage exclusive task state
- Fixed `can_schedule()` logic to prevent scheduling any task when an exclusive task is running

### 2. Fixed Dependency Failure Handling
- Updated `_get_ready_tasks()` to skip tasks when any of their dependencies fail
- Tasks with failed dependencies are now marked as SKIPPED instead of waiting forever
- This prevents deadlock where tasks wait indefinitely for failed dependencies to complete

### 3. Simplified Async Event Coordination
- Removed complex anyio Event wait/reset logic that was causing issues
- Replaced with simple `anyio.sleep(0.1)` polling in both scheduler and wait loops
- Removed unused imports and event signaling code

### 4. Fixed Test Issues
- Added missing `TaskStatus` import to test file
- Updated test expectations to match new behavior (task4 is SKIPPED when task2 fails)

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Hanging**: Async tests complete quickly without hanging
2. **Proper Failure Handling**: Tasks with failed dependencies are properly skipped
3. **Exclusive Task Support**: Exclusive tasks now correctly prevent other tasks from running
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed complex event coordination in favor of simple polling

The parallel execution feature is now working correctly with all tests passing.
