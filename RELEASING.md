# Release Process

This document outlines the release process for the claude-code-prompter project.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a release, ensure you have:

1. **Push access** to the main repository
2. **PyPI account** with maintainer access to `claude-code-prompter`
3. **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed and authenticated
4. **Python build tools** installed:
   ```bash
   pip install build twine
   ```

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version (1.0.0): Breaking API changes
- **MINOR** version (0.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** version (0.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Release Process

```

### 2. Create Release Commit and Tag

```

### 5. Publish to PyPI

#### 5.1 Clean Previous Builds
```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info/
```

```

This creates:
- `dist/claude_code_prompter-0.x.x-py3-none-any.whl`
- `dist/claude_code_prompter-0.x.x.tar.gz`

#### 5.3 Upload to PyPI
```bash
# For test release (optional)
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# For production release
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### 6. Post-Release Verification

#### 6.1 Verify PyPI Package
```bash
# In a fresh virtual environment
pip install claude-code-prompter==0.x.x
prompter --version
```

#### 6.2 Verify GitHub Release
- Check https://github.com/baijum/prompter/releases
- Ensure release notes are properly formatted
- Verify source code archives are attached

#### 6.3 Update Documentation (if needed)
- Update README.md badges if version changed
- Update any version-specific documentation

## Release Checklist Template

Copy this checklist for each release:

```markdown
## Release Checklist for v0.x.x

### Pre-release
- [ ] All tests passing (`make test`)
- [ ] Code quality checks passing (`make all`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with release notes
- [ ] Version bumped in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)

### Release
- [ ] Release commit created
- [ ] Tag created (`git tag -a v0.x.x -m "..."`)
- [ ] Tag pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub release created with `gh release create`
- [ ] Commits pushed to main branch

### Publishing
- [ ] Distribution built (`python -m build`)
- [ ] Package uploaded to PyPI (`python -m twine upload dist/*`)
- [ ] Installation verified in clean environment

### Post-release
- [ ] PyPI page shows new version
- [ ] GitHub release page is properly formatted
- [ ] Installation works: `pip install claude-code-prompter==0.x.x`
- [ ] Announce release (if applicable)
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Tests Failing
- Run `make all` to see all issues
- Fix any linting issues with `ruff format .`
- Address type errors shown by mypy
- Ensure all new code has tests

### 2. PyPI Upload Errors
- Ensure you're authenticated: `python -m twine upload --username __token__`
- Check for existing version (can't overwrite)
- Verify package metadata in pyproject.toml

### 3. GitHub Release Issues
- Ensure `gh` is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Tag must exist before creating release
- Use proper markdown formatting in release notes

## Emergency Procedures

### Rolling Back a Release

If a critical issue is found after release:

1. **Create a patch release** (preferred):
   ```bash
   # Fix the issue
   # Bump version to 0.x.x+1
   # Follow normal release process
   ```

2. **Delete and recreate** (last resort):
   ```bash
   # Delete GitHub release (keeps tag)
   gh release delete v0.x.x

   # Delete tag locally and remotely
   git tag -d v0.x.x
   git push origin :refs/tags/v0.x.x

   # Note: Cannot delete from PyPI - must create new version
   ```

## Automation Opportunities

Consider automating these steps in the future:
- Version bumping based on commit messages
- CHANGELOG generation from commit history
- Automated testing on release tags
- PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions

## Questions?

If you have questions about the release process:
1. Check existing releases for examples
2. Open an issue for clarification
3. Discuss in PR before making changes
