# Pytest Markers Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CONTRIBUTING.md
- Added comprehensive documentation about pytest markers (unit, integration, slow, asyncio)
- Provided examples of how to run tests with different marker combinations
- Listed specific tests that have each marker applied
- Updated Make commands documentation to reflect new test targets

### 2. Updated Makefile
Added new test targets to make marker usage easier:
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only (exclude integration and slow tests)
- `make test-slow` - Run slow tests only
- `make test-fast` - Run fast tests only (exclude slow tests)
- `make coverage-unit` - Run unit tests with coverage (exclude integration and slow tests)

### 3. Fixed Missing Import
- Added missing `import pytest` to `tests/test_progress_display.py`

### 4. Markers Already Defined
The pytest markers were already properly defined in `pytest.ini`:
```ini
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests
    slow: Slow running tests
    asyncio: Async test cases
```

## Test Organization

### Slow Tests (@pytest.mark.slow)
Applied to tests with time delays or significant processing:
- `test_parallel_execution.py::test_parallel_execution_respects_dependencies`
- `test_progress_display.py::test_thread_safety`
- All tests in `test_parallel_integration.py::TestParallelIntegration`

### Integration Tests (@pytest.mark.integration)
Applied to tests that test multiple components together:
- `test_parallel_integration.py::TestParallelIntegration`
- `test_parallel_integration_simple.py::TestParallelExecutionIntegration`
- `test_parallel_demo.py::TestParallelExecutionDemo`
- `test_integration.py::TestEndToEndIntegration`

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run only fast unit tests (for quick feedback)
make test-unit

# Run all tests except slow ones
make test-fast

# Run only integration tests
make test-integration

# Run only slow tests
make test-slow

# Run unit tests with coverage
make coverage-unit
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Development Feedback**: Developers can run `make test-unit` for quick feedback during development
2. **CI/CD Optimization**: Different test stages can run appropriate test subsets
3. **Better Test Organization**: Clear categorization of test types
4. **Flexible Test Execution**: Easy to run specific categories of tests as needed

## Note on Test Execution

Some tests may take longer than expected or appear to hang. This is often due to:
- Parallel execution tests that simulate real work with sleep delays
- Integration tests that perform actual file I/O operations
- Thread safety tests that intentionally create race conditions

If tests appear hung, you can:
1. Run with verbose output: `pytest -v`
2. Run with timeout: `pytest --timeout=300`
3. Run specific test files or methods to isolate issues
