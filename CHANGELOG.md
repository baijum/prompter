## [0.9.0] - 2025-06-27

### üöÄ New Features

- **Task-Specific System Prompts**
  - New `system_prompt` task configuration option allows customizing Claude's behavior for individual tasks
  - Enables enforcing planning before execution, setting expertise context, and adding safety constraints
  - Particularly powerful for critical operations, complex refactoring, and multi-phase workflows
  - Can be combined with `resume_previous_session` for context-aware, role-specific task execution
  - Example use cases:
    - Enforce detailed planning before making changes
    - Set Claude as a domain expert (security, database, performance, etc.)
    - Add safety constraints for production deployments
    - Control output style and approach for different tasks

### üîß Configuration

- **New Task Option: `system_prompt`**
  - Optional string that customizes Claude's behavior for the specific task
  - When not specified, Claude uses its default behavior
  - Example configuration:
    ```toml
    [[tasks]]
    name = "careful_refactor"
    prompt = "Refactor the payment processing module"
    system_prompt = "You are a senior engineer working on payment systems. Safety is paramount. Before making ANY changes, create a detailed plan including: 1) What will be changed, 2) Potential risks, 3) How to test each change. Present the plan and wait for approval."
    verify_command = "python -m pytest tests/payment/"
    ```

### üìö Documentation

- Added comprehensive documentation section on system prompts with common patterns
- Created three new example workflows:
  - `planning-workflow.toml` - Demonstrates enforcing planning before implementation
  - `safe-production-deploy.toml` - Shows safety-critical deployment with multiple system prompts
  - `code-review-workflow.toml` - Multi-perspective automated code review
- Updated CLAUDE.md with system prompt behavior documentation

## [0.8.0] - 2025-06-27

### üöÄ New Features

- **Claude Session Resumption for Context Preservation**
  - New `resume_previous_session` task configuration option enables maintaining full context across tasks
  - Tasks can now preserve Claude's entire conversation history from previous task executions
  - Allows building complex, context-aware workflows where later tasks can reference and build upon earlier results
  - Maintains Claude's understanding of the codebase, modifications made, and project structure
  - Particularly useful for multi-step refactoring, progressive code improvements, and iterative development workflows

### üîß Configuration

- **New Task Option: `resume_previous_session`**
  - Boolean option (default: `false`) that controls whether to resume the previous Claude session
  - When `true`, the task starts with the full conversation history from the previous task
  - Example configuration:
    ```toml
    [[tasks]]
    name = "analyze_code"
    prompt = "Analyze the codebase for potential improvements"
    verify_command = "echo 'Analysis complete'"

    [[tasks]]
    name = "implement_improvements"
    prompt = "Based on your analysis, implement the top 3 improvements"
    resume_previous_session = true
    verify_command = "python -m pytest"
    ```
